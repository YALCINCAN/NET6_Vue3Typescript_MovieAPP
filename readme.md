## How To Start .Net API

For api, you must edit the appsettings.json file before typing these commands.
I used postgresql as database but you can change it in the program.cs file  

```sh
dotnet ef migrations add CreateDatabase --context MovieContext --project "DataAccess" --startup-project "WebAPI"
dotnet ef database update --context MovieContext --project "DataAccess" --startup-project "WebAPI"
```
After these commands, a database will be created.
