## How To Start .Net API

For api, you must edit the appsettings.json file before typing these commands.
I used postgresql as database but you can change it

Docker support added you can start project with docker, first you must look docker compose yaml file rediscache settings eg. and write 

```sh
docker compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up -d --build
```
When the project is up, the migrations run automatically, but you can run it manually with the following command.

```sh
dotnet ef database update --context MovieContext --project "DataAccess" --startup-project "WebAPI"
```

After these commands, a database will be created.
